work sequentially

works in phases, makes optimized decisions in local scenes thinking that it ll sum up to a global
optimized decision (decision is taken based on what is right at present)

choosing local optimum leads to global optimum at the end

eg- graph, scheduling algorithms

cashier's algorithm
finding minimum number of denominations

SJF policy
avg waiting time is minimum is the goal
sort in increasing order of burst time and apply FCFS

***these algorithms might not produce optimum results always.

***Easier to design, compared to Divide & Conquer.

***Difficult to prove its correctness.
