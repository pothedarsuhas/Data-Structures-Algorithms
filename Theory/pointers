reference and pointer

call by reference is used in python

pointer is a variable stores the address of another variable
reference is a variable which referes to another variable

i = [1,2,3]
j = i
i[0] = 5
print(j) #[5, 2, 3]

this means that reference is created as 'j' to 'i'
hence pointers exist in python
