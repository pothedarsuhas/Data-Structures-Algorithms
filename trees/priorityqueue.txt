priority queues, variation of FIFO queue

insertion order is based on the priority

application - scheduling

package heapq

heapify() converts the list into a minheap, least element at the first, still maintaining the order
heappop() removes item maintaining the order of the queue
heappush() removes item maintaining the order of the queue

minheap and maxheap forms min at front and max at front respectively

binary heap ~ implement a priority queue
list based insertion O(n), del O(nlogn)
binary heap(binary tree) based insertion & deletion O(logn)

binary tree ~ min heap
1. It has all nodes in all levels except leaf ~ complete binary trees
2. value at each node is less than its children

in min/max heaps
index of child // 2 = index of parent when indices start from 1
